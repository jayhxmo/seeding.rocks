                    <h2>Seeding.rocks enables people to access websites as if they were torrents with no effort by the client. Instead of directly sending clients data the main server will redirect people to peers who will give them the data. This enables servers to run with minimal bandwidth. This allows static sites to circumvent the FCC's "slow lane".</h2>

This model is shown to be resilient in some torrenting solutions that continue to exist despite repeated efforts to stop them. This is also similar in some ways to the "deepnet" with its  distributed websites except all client side software is in-browser javascript making its use simple.</h2>
